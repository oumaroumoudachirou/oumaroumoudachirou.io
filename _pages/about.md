<h4>Welcome to my home page!</h4>  
 <!-- <br/> est pour inserer une ligne vide -->
<br/>
I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at  [University of Montreal](https://sceco.umontreal.ca/english/home/) and  a member of [CIREQ](https://cireqmontreal.com/). 


<p align="justify">My research focuses on <strong> macroeconomics, fiscal policy, and international economics. </strong> I use quantitative models to address questions related to the design of optimal fiscal rules  in order to regulate the government's spending and serve the interests of the citizens.   </p>


<p align="justify"> Before joining the Ph.D. program, I hold an MSc. in Economics and Statistics, and a BSc. in Applied Statistics. I have worked as an Economist-Statistician at <a href='https://www.worldbank.org/en/who-we-are/'>The World Bank</a>, <a href='https://www.bceao.int/en/content/presentation-bceao/'>BCEAO</a>, and <a href='https://www.norc.org/'>NORC</a>, as well as at National Statistics Office.</p>
